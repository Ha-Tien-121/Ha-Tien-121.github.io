    <p>Caption: Image and gif of the circuit board. The value of the resistors used was 220 mA. Using a datasheet I found on octoparts, I found the DC current and calculated the appropriate resistance to use. The DC current for each LED light was red = 30 mA, 
      yellow = 20, green = 30. Using the equation V = I * R, I calculated mA to A, subsituted I with the LED values, and subsituted V with 3.2. V is 3.2 because you start with 5 volts and loose 1.8 volts with time. Therefore, the Resistance values I got was 106.7 
      for red and green. I got 160 for yellow. The resistor that made the most sense to use was 220 mA.

      <p>Caption: My Schematic = The 3 LED lights derives its power source from 3 pins, which are 13, 12, and 11. The power is goes to the LED light without a resistor. 
        But, a resistor limits the voltage running to one wire connected to the ground.

      <h3> 2. </h3>
      <p> Arduino Uno has 14 digital I/O pins and 6 can be used as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs. So, for an Arduino Uno, you could independently control up to 14 LEDs using the digital I/O pins.
        As for how much current that would draw, a common current value for small LEDs is around 20 mA (0.02 A). So using this equation: Total Current= Number of LEDs × Current per LED = 14 × 20 mA =  280 mA. The total current would be 280 mA.

      <h3> 4. </h3>
      <p> The sweet spot that I found for how fast you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking was 10 miliseconds.</p>
