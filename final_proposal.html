    <h1>Final Project Proposal!</h1>

    <h3>Concept/Motivation: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>“I want to upgrade a plant stand I have into a complete plant care system! My apartment gets very little light in so I want it to be LED lights that I can control with a remote control that has perfect settings a plant’s light needs. The stand will also have a built in temperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. If I’m feeling ambitious, I also plan on building in an automated watering function.”</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Bill of Materials: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LEDs strip lights (plant growing lights)</li>
        <li>RGB lights (to indicate health status) </li>
        <li>Remote control (for controlling LED strip) </li>
        <li>Temp + Humidity sensor (for temp sensing) </li>
        <li>IR receiver (for remote control) </li>
        <li>Assorted resistors (for current-limiting) </li>
        <li>Soil Moisture Sensor (to sensor soil moisture) </li>
        <li>LCD display (to display sensor readings) </li>
        <li>Plant stand (to upgrade) </li>      
    </ul>
    <h3>Timeline and contingency plans:</h3>
        <p>2/26-27: Implement the circuit and code for the LED strip light and remote control. <br />
        2/28 -29: Implement circuit and code for the sensors and reading displays<br />
        2/28 - 3/1: Build the product, conduct testing, make any necessary revisions<br />
        3/1 - 3/3: Finish demo video & work on documentation<br />
        3/4: Presentation & submit documentation<br />
        (If extra time + energy: implement the circuit and code for water pump)<br />
        If anything goes wrong, I will just settle for the MVP which is LED lights and temp sensor. <br />
        I’m going to be making this as a gift to my sister so hopefully she likes it!</p>
