    <p>Caption: The project I created allows the user to press one of the buttons to increase the brightness of the LED light or fade it to a lower brightness. 
      Another button allows the user to change the color of the LED light with each click of the button.

      <p>Caption: The schematic of the circuits includes one multi-colored LED light and two buttons. Three prongs of the LED are connected to pins ~10, ~9, and ~6
        through resistors. Another prong of the LED is connected to the ground. The first push button is attached to a power source of 5V and pin 2. The second button is attached
        to a power source of 3.3V and pin ~3. Both buttons are connected to the ground through a resistor.
